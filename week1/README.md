## Week 1
In this week, our goal is to learn how to evaluate and analysis video frames:
1. Understand and become familiar with the programming framework used in the project (Python).
2. Learn about the databases to be used
3. Implement the evaluation metrics and graphs used during the module.
4. Read / write sequences of images and associated segmentation ground truth.

To check all the tasks, there is a week1_launch file to direatly get the results in each task.

# task1 precision and recall
task1.1 Given the ground truth and results of two methods(A andd B), to get the precision, recall and f1-score and analysis the performance.
task1.2 Background Substraction (qualitative)

# task2 Temporal analysis of the results
task2.1 TP and TF vs frames
task2.2 F1-score vs frames

# task3 quantitative evaluation of optical flow
task3.1 MSEN
task3.2 PEPN
task3.3 Analysis & Visualizations

# task4 De-synchronization of results
Force de-synchronized results for background substraction and study the results 

# task5 Optical flow plot
plot and visualize the optical flow
