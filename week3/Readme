# Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring
Master in Computer Vision - M6 Visual Analysis

 
# Week 3
In this week, our goal is to learn how to :  
1. Implement a robust foreground segmentation algorithm.
2. Basic post filtering strategies as Hole filling, are filling and morphological operators.
3. A strategy to remove shadows.



## Task 1: Hole filling
- Task1: post process the previous week method with hole filling, with 4 and 8 connectivity and provide gain on AUC.

   Instructions:  task1.py  

## Task 2: Area filtering
- Task2.1: AUC vs #pixels: Plot the AUC vs the number of pixels of are filtering.

  Instructions:  
  
- Task2.2: Argument max of AUC depending on the P, to find the highest mean of AUC for each sequence.

  Instructions: 

## Task 3: Morphological processing
- Task3: Morphological filtering: Apply various morphological operations (opening and closing) with different structuring elements.

  Instructions:  task3.py  | given a foreground it applies the morph operation desired with the desired structuring element.
