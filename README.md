## Motivation   
The goal of this 5-week project is to learn the basic concepts and techniques related to video sequences processing, mainly for surveillance applications. We have proposed a video surveillance system which is able to track vehicles passing by the road and predict their speeds. In addition, we extended our system as a Collision Detector for a better usage in Traffic System.  

## Vehicle Tracking  

*Kalman filter   

*Deep Learning (RNN YOLO v2)  


## Speed Estimation  


## Collision Detector
