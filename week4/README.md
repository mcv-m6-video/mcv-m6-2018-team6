Master in Computer Vision - M6 Visual Analysis  

 
# Week 4
In this week, our goal is to learn how to :  
1. Estimate the optical flow of a video sequence.  
2. Use the optical flow to stabilize any potential camera jitter.  

## Task 1: Optical Flow  
- Task1.1 Optical Flow with block matching: To compute the optical flow with block matching it has been computed the block matching between 2 consecutives frames and compared with its ground truth to assess the MSEN and PEPN.

   Instructions:  task1_1.py (MSEN and PEPN plots)

- Task1.2 Block Matching vs Other Techniques:

   Instructions: T.B.D.
 

## Task 2: Video stabilization
- Task2.1 Video Stabilization with Block matching: using the optical flow, it is stabilized a video and compared the performance of the foreground evaluation.
  
  Instructions:  task2_1.py  (gif of the ) | task2_1AUC.py (Precision-Recall curve)
  
- Task2.2 Block Matching Stabilization vs Other Techniques:

  Instructions:  T.B.D.
  
- Task2.3 Stabilize your own video: using a 3 sec video it is stabilized and compared qualitatively with the other techniques used and the original non stabilized.
  
  Instructions: based on task 2.1 and 2.2 but first extracting the frames from the video with this web: https://www.filezigzag.com/mp4-jpeg-en.aspx
